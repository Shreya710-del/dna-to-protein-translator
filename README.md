# 🧬 DNA to Protein Translator – AI + Biotech Mini Project

This is a beginner-friendly Python project that simulates **DNA transcription and translation** into a **protein sequence**.

---

## 🔬 Project Overview

| Step | Process |
|------|---------|
| 🧬 DNA | ATGGCCGAA |
| 🔁 Transcription | DNA → RNA (AUGGCCGAA) |
| 🔤 Translation | RNA codons → Amino acids (Methionine-Alanine-Glutamic Acid) |

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

- 🐍 Python (Google Colab)
- 📊 Google Sheets (optional visualization)
- 📁 GitHub
- 💡 ChatGPT (AI assistance)

## 📜 Sample Code Output

DNA Sequence: ATGGCCGAA
RNA Sequence: AUGGCCGAA
Protein Sequence: Methionine-Alanine-Glutamic Acid

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Basics of string operations and loops in Python
- How DNA is transcribed and translated in real cells
- The power of combining biology with code!

---

## 🪄 Future Improvements

- Add all 64 codons to the dictionary
- GUI interface (Streamlit)
- Batch processing of sequences
